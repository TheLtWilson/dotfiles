# Lt. Wilson's Dotfiles
I haven't finished this. But here's my Linux dotfiles :3

## Install These
You'll need to install these to fully utilize my dotfiles, as well as a nerd font for icons. In my files, I use JetBrains Mono for most things, but you can download one that fits your aesthetic [over here.](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)
